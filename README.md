# -kr-comp-challenge-1

This project is about the wrestling legends from my youth and a humorous tribute to my grandmother.Grandma Angie used to take me and my brothers to local wrestling matches at the LaCrescent VFW down the hill from her house. She often was the loudest fan in the building and new all the wrestlers personally (it was a small town). I created the icons from images I found on google and set them as background images in CSS. I struggled a bit to get them to respond to the hover command but with some good advice and probably too much trial and error, it came together. I was able to make it responsive but feel as thoght the transition from one screen size to another could be more smooth. I had fun with the project and learned a lot about CSS. I look forward to applying what I have learned to the next project, including better time management and more efficient resource searches.
